# 🎉 PWA Version - Complete Package Ready!

## What You Have

All files for a Progressive Web App version of your Lithuanian vocabulary app that can be installed on phones like a native app!

## 📦 Files Included

1. **index.html** - Your working app with PWA features added
2. **manifest.json** - Configuration for app installation
3. **service-worker.js** - Makes app work offline
4. **icon-192.png** - Small app icon
5. **icon-512.png** - Large app icon
6. **README.md** - User documentation
7. **GITHUB-SETUP-GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step instructions for you
8. **create-icons.html** - Tool to create custom icons (if you want different colors later)

## ✅ What Changed from HTML Version

**ADDED:**
- `<link rel="manifest">` in HTML
- Service worker registration script
- Manifest file
- App icons

**NOT CHANGED:**
- All your app functionality
- All the fixes we made
- The completion screen
- Any of the working code

**Result:** Same app + installable + works offline!

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Separate Repository (RECOMMENDED)
**Safest approach - keeps things completely separate**

1. Create a NEW repository on GitHub: `lithuanian-vocab-pwa`
2. Upload all the PWA files to it
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Now you have:
   - Original repo: HTML version (safe!)
   - New repo: PWA version (to test!)

### Option 2: New Branch in Same Repository
**Keeps everything in one place**

1. Create a new branch called `pwa-version`
2. Upload PWA files to that branch
3. Keep `main` branch as HTML version
4. Switch GitHub Pages to deploy from `pwa-version` branch

**See GITHUB-SETUP-GUIDE.md for detailed instructions!**

## 📱 What Students Will Experience

### Before (HTML version):
1. Open bookmark
2. Use in browser

### After (PWA version):
1. Open link once
2. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
3. Forever after: Just tap the app icon!
4. Works offline
5. No browser UI (looks like real app)

## 💡 Benefits

✅ **FREE** - No costs at all
✅ **No App Store** - No approval needed
✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on iPhone, Android, desktop
✅ **Easy updates** - Just update on GitHub
✅ **Offline** - Works without internet (after first load)
✅ **Safe** - Your original code is untouched

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- PWA requires HTTPS (GitHub Pages has this automatically)
- Students might need to visit page 2-3 times before install prompt shows
- iOS Safari requires manual "Add to Home Screen" (no automatic prompt)
- First visit needs internet, then works offline

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before sharing with students:

- [ ] Upload all files to GitHub
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages
- [ ] Visit URL on YOUR phone
- [ ] Try installing it
- [ ] Test that it works after installation
- [ ] Try using it offline (turn off wifi)
- [ ] Test on both Android and iPhone if possible

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

**Don't panic!** Your original HTML version is safe. You can:

1. Delete the PWA branch/repo
2. Go back to the HTML version
3. Start over
4. Or just keep using the HTML version

The PWA is an ENHANCEMENT, not a requirement!

## 📚 Resources

- **GITHUB-SETUP-GUIDE.md** - Follow this step-by-step
- **README.md** - Share this with students for how to install

## 🎓 My Recommendation

1. **Today:** Upload to GitHub as separate repo or branch
2. **Test:** Install on YOUR phone, use it for a day
3. **Share:** If you like it, share with 1-2 students to test
4. **Roll out:** If they like it, share with whole class
5. **Fallback:** Keep HTML version link as backup
